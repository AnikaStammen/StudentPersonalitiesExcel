# Student Data Imputation in Excel and Storytelling

**Project Overview**
The project focused on cleansing and analyzing survey data collected from students at a university, intended to profile an "imaginary friend." The objective was to process and clean the raw survey data, impute missing values, and draw meaningful insights about the student demographics and characteristics. The value of this project lies in improving data accuracy and providing reliable data for further academic studies and administrative use. The excel with the data and imputation of missing values as well as merged with the personality data can be found in the repository, as well as the assignment.

**Data Description**
The dataset comprised survey responses from students, covering various demographic and personal attributes such as age, exam results, commuting distance, and more. The data also included personality traits gathered through a separate survey. Missing data points were addressed using regression techniques in Microsoft Excel, particularly focusing on variables with potential predictive relationships.

**Analysis and Insights**
The project's analysis involved imputing missing values using statistical methods such as regression analysis, where relationships between independent variables like siblings' age and dependent variables such as the student's age were explored. This step was crucial to maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the data for subsequent analyses.

**Visualizations and Results**
Visual insights were generated using Power BI, providing interactive visualizations that helped identify and interpret data trends and anomalies. The analysis highlighted outliers and unusual patterns, such as unexpectedly high or low CAO scores and discrepancies in commuting distances that could indicate data entry errors or unusual individual circumstances.

**Conclusion**
The cleaned and analyzed data provides a more accurate and detailed view of the student body, useful for both academic and administrative purposes. The project underscored the importance of thorough data cleaning and the need for careful consideration of the methods used to impute missing values. Recommendations include the continued use of advanced analytical tools to enhance the quality of data collected and maintained by educational institutions.
